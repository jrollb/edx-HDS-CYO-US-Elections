Report title: "2020 US Presidential Elections: The Swing States"

The submission contains the three files
1.) "2020_US_Presidential_Elections.R" contains the R-code (data wrangling and complete analysis)
2.) "2020_US_Presidential_Elections.Rmd" creates the report (here as pdf)
3.) "2020_US_Presidential_Elections.pdf" contains the detailed project report

The folder "Data" contains three input files
A.) "county_statistics.csv"
B.) "countypres_2000-2016.csv"
C.) "president_county_candidate.csv"

The sources are described below and in the pdf report.

NOTE: The "Data" folder is required. Please run the "2020_US_Presidential_Elections.R" first. It will save the merged dataset as .rds file. The .Rmd file will read the .rds file.
